# Facial Keypoints Detection: Detection the location of keypoints on face images:

The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

* tracking faces in images and video;
* analysing facial expressions;
* detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis;
* biometrics / face recognition.

Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.

The data set for this competition was graciously provided by *Dr. Yoshua Bengio* of the University of Montreal.

## Training and testing data:

Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices. There are 15 keypoints, which represent the following elements of the face:

* left_eye_center;
* right_eye_center;
* left_eye_inner_corner;
* left_eye_outer_corner;
* right_eye_inner_corner;
* right_eye_outer_corner;
* left_eyebrow_inner_end;
* left_eyebrow_outer_end;
* right_eyebrow_inner_end;
* right_eyebrow_outer_end;
* nose_tip;
* mouth_left_corner;
* mouth_right_corner;
* mouth_center_top_lip;
* mouth_center_bottom_lip.
